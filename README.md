# Handwritten Digits Classification
## Overview
Handwritten digits classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves identifying and classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from images. This repository contains code and resources for building and training a model to perform handwritten digits classification using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Details
Problem Statement: The goal of handwritten digits classification is to develop a model that can accurately predict the digit represented by a given image.
Applications: This problem has practical applications in various fields such as postal automation, document processing, and security systems.
## Techniques Used
Deep Learning: Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance in handwritten digits classification.
Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
### Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository: git clone <https://github.com/Usamarana01/Handwritten-digits-classification/edit/main>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook: jupyter notebook
 ## Dataset:
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.
## Results
After training the model, it achieved an accuracy of approximately  92% on the test dataset.
